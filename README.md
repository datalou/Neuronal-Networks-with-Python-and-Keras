This repository contains code and resources for building neural networks using Python and Keras. 
Neural networks have gained significant attention in recent years for their ability to learn and make predictions based on data. 
This project aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to neural networks and guide you through the process of building and training your own models using Python and Keras.

## Introduction
Neural networks are a subfield of machine learning inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. 
They consist of interconnected layers of artificial neurons, known as nodes or units, that can learn from and make predictions on complex patterns in data. 
Neural networks have been successful in a wide range of applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and time series analysis.

This repository provides a step-by-step guide to understanding and implementing neural networks using Python and Keras. 
It covers the basics of neural networks, including the architecture and types of layers, activation functions, loss functions, and optimization algorithms. 
Additionally, it explores more advanced concepts like regularization, hyperparameter tuning, and handling imbalanced datasets.
